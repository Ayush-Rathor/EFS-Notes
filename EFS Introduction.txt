 Amazon EFS Overview
- Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) provides a cloud-native, serverless, shared file system optimized for cost and performance.
- Launched in 2016, EFS offers a user-friendly, fully managed file system for business-critical applications requiring shared storage.
- EFS allows you to scale storage seamlessly, and it is compatible with different AWS services and on-premises resources.
- Key features:
  - Fully managed shared file system
  - Scalable storage and performance
  - High availability and durability
  - Security
  - Cost optimization

 1. Fully Managed Shared File System üõ†Ô∏è
- Serverless and managed: No need for infrastructure provisioning or management.
- File system sharing: Supports tens of thousands of concurrent clients, including:
  - EC2 instances
  - Containers (Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, AWS Fargate)
  - AWS Lambda (serverless functions)
- Benefits: Simplifies the management of shared storage for applications, reducing administrative overhead.

 2. Scalable Storage and Performance üìà
- Elastic scalability: Automatically scales to meet storage needs, from GB to petabytes, without manual intervention.
- Performance scalability: Supports up to tens of GB per second of throughput and 500,000+ IOPS.
- Storage cost management: You only pay for the storage you use, avoiding over-provisioning.
  
# Performance Modes üèéÔ∏è
- General Purpose Mode: 
  - Default mode.
  - Best for most workloads like web serving, content management, home directories, etc.
- Max I/O Mode: 
  - Recommended for high-throughput and IOPS workloads like big data, media processing, and genomic analysis.
  - Trade-off: Slightly higher latencies for file metadata operations.

# Throughput Modes üöÄ
- Bursting Throughput: 
  - Default mode.
  - Performance increases with the amount of data stored, suitable for most workloads.
- Provisioned Throughput: 
  - Recommended for workloads needing higher throughput per storage unit.
  - Allows instant throughput provisioning (in MiB/s), independent of the storage amount.

 3. High Availability and Durability üåê
- 99.99% SLA for availability.
- 11 nines of durability for stored data.
- Designed to handle high availability across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).

---

 4. Security üîí
- Access control: Multiple layers of security to control access to EFS:
  - POSIX Permissions: Use UNIX-style user and group permissions to manage access.
  - Amazon VPC Security Groups: Restrict network access to EFS from specific VPCs and IPs.
  - IAM Roles: Control creation, modification, and client access using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
  - AWS KMS Encryption: Use AWS Key Management Service for data encryption at rest and TLS for data in transit.
- CloudTrail Logging: IAM-based NFS client access and authorization decisions are logged for visibility.

---

 5. Cost Optimization üí∏
- Pay-per-use pricing: Only pay for the storage you consume with no minimum fee or setup cost.
- Storage classes:
  - Standard: High availability and durability across multiple AZs.
  - Standard-IA: Lower-cost tier for infrequently accessed data.
  - One Zone: Saves costs by storing data in a single AZ with lower latencies.
  - One Zone-IA: Infrequently accessed data in one AZ, offering cost savings.
- Lifecycle management: Automatically moves data to lower-cost storage tiers based on access frequency using intelligent tiering.
