# 🖥️ AWS Modern Compute Services and Amazon EFS  
- Why Integration Matters:  
  - Migrating applications to containers and serverless platforms simplifies operations, reduces costs, and ensures elastic scaling.  
- Key Integrations:  
  - Amazon ECS  
  - Amazon EKS  
  - AWS Fargate  
  - AWS Lambda  
- Benefits:  
  - Applications requiring shared persistent storage can use elastic and serverless storage.  
  - Simplifies migration from self-managed storage to modern infrastructure.  
- Example with Lambda:  
  - Parse large files seamlessly by leveraging Amazon EFS as a shared, persistent storage layer.  
  - Enables Lambda to handle larger datasets beyond its 512 MB temporary disk space.

# 💾 Amazon EFS and Lambda Integration  
- Without Amazon EFS:  
  - Persistent datasets larger than 512 MB were unsupported.  
  - Shared data across Lambda functions was unavailable.  
- With Amazon EFS:  
  - Load libraries and data files during the first invocation.  
  - Manage large files (e.g., unzipping a 1 GB file) with ease using a few lines of code.  
  - Set an Amazon EFS file system as the local mount path directly in the Lambda console.  

---

# 🔒 Amazon EFS and AWS Backup  
- Features:  
  - Enables automatic backups for file systems via the EFS console, API, or AWS CLI.  
  - Uses default backup vaults and recommended settings for automation.  
- AWS Backup Benefits:  
  - Simplifies creation, migration, restoration, and deletion of backups.  
  - Provides detailed reporting and auditing for backup activities.  
- Requirements:  
  - File systems must be in a region where AWS Backup is available.

# 📊 Amazon EFS and Monitoring: CloudWatch Integration  
- Key Questions Answered:  
  - How to determine throughput?  
  - How to track connected EC2 instances?  
- Features:  
  - Real-time metrics collection and processing at no extra cost.  
  - Historical data storage for 15 months to analyze performance trends.  
- Ways to Use CloudWatch with Amazon EFS:  
  1. View metrics in the Amazon EFS console.  
  2. Create alerts in the CloudWatch console.  
  3. Retrieve data via the CloudWatch CLI.  
  4. Integrate with the CloudWatch API.
